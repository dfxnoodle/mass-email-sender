# Flask 3.1 Upgrade Guide

## What Changed

This project has been successfully upgraded from Flask 2.3.3 to Flask 3.1.0.

### Dependencies Updated

- **Flask**: 2.3.3 → 3.1.1
- **Werkzeug**: 2.3.7 → 3.1.3

### Code Compatibility

The existing codebase was already compatible with Flask 3.1.0. No code changes were required because:

1. **send_file usage**: Already using the modern `download_name` parameter instead of the deprecated `attachment_filename`
2. **No deprecated features**: The codebase doesn't use any features that were removed in Flask 3.1
3. **Template system**: Jinja2 templates are fully compatible
4. **Routing and views**: All route handlers work without modification

### Key Benefits of Flask 3.1

1. **Performance improvements**: Better performance for template rendering and request handling
2. **Security updates**: Latest security patches and improvements
3. **Bug fixes**: Various bug fixes from the Flask team
4. **Better error handling**: Improved error messages and debugging experience
5. **Modern Python support**: Better support for Python 3.12+

### Breaking Changes (None affecting this project)

Flask 3.1 removed some deprecated features, but none were used in this codebase:

- Deprecated `__version__` attribute (we don't use version checking)
- Some old template context functions (we use modern template syntax)
- Legacy WSGI middleware (we use the built-in development server)

### Testing

The application was tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ All imports work correctly
- ✅ No deprecation warnings for our code
- ✅ Development server runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Production Considerations

For production deployment, ensure:

1. Use a production WSGI server (gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.)
2. Set `debug=False` in production
3. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
4. Consider using Flask's application factory pattern for larger applications

### Rollback Instructions

If needed to rollback to Flask 2.3.3:

```bash
pip install Flask==2.3.3 Werkzeug==2.3.7
```

However, this is not recommended as Flask 3.1 includes important security updates.
